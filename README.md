# Graphics-Origin

## What is it
This project contains three libraries to develop Computer Graphics applications:
- tools, for the utilities commonly used in an application (e.g. log, simple 
file system functions, ...)
- geometry, to represent geometric objects such as triangles, points, rotations 
as well as operations on those objects (e.g. intersection tests).
- application, to easily setup 3D applications.

This project is meant to be used by students, researcher and practitioners in 
Computer Graphics, with a beginner to intermediate level in graphical 
application development. This is the code used for my research applications as 
well as for the projects of some of my students. Be aware that this is an 
ongoing project; I will add more features and documentation in the future (as 
well as removing more and more bugs :-}). If you want to participate in this 
project, feel free to contact me.

People looking for a professional solution (much more features, better 
performance, support and so on), are advised to read about projects such as 
[Ogre](http://www.ogre3d.org/) or [Unity](https://unity3d.com/).

## Configuration
The code has been tested on a limited set of platforms, including:
- GNU/Linux platforms, compiled with gcc 5.2, 5.3 and 6.1
- ~~Windows 64 bits, with Visual Studio 14~~ not supported anymore. I never use
the Windows version due to the lack of OpenMP support in MSVC. Thus, I prefer to use
my free time to work only on the Linux version, for now.

## Installation
A documentation about installation is available at the following page:
[Virtual Atom](http://www.virtual-atom.com/pages/projects/graphics_origin.html).

## Licensing
This code is release under the MIT Licence. Please see the file called LICENCE.
