   * We have three setups for parallelization:
   * - OpenCL (CPU/GPU)
   * - OpenMP (CPU only)
   * - none.
   * Originally, it was CUDA only, but it was not general enough.
   *
   * Code for OpenMP can be reused when no parallelization is requested:
   * - if the system does not have OpenMP, pragmas are ignored
   * - if the system does have OpenMP, we can set the max number of threads
   * to 1.
   *
   * Still, some code might require including OpenMP header or use specific
   * functions. Thus, we need to be careful and use:
   * # ifdef GO_USE_OPENMP
   * //... do something
   * # endif
   *
   * A similar macro is available for OpenCL:
   * # ifdef GO_USE_OPENCL
   * //... do something with OpenCL
   * # endif
   *
   * When both OpenMP and OpenCL are available, we need a way to select which one
   * to use.
