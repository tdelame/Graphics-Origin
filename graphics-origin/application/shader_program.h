  /**
   * The application will have more than one OpenGL context. There will be at
   * least one context used and managed by Qt, and one context by GL Window. All
   * openGL command must be issued when the correct context is bound. We know
   * for sure the context of a GL Window is bound when the draw function is
   * called. If we want to change the current context at any time, we could
   * change it when it is needed by other part of the code and thus create a big
   * mess. Thus, we should take care than any openGL command is issued only *in*
   * the draw function of the GL window.
   *
   * This is not particularly constraining, as GL commands are meant to occur
   * during rendering, except for the shader program construction, source
   * loading and reloading. One solution might be to only set the shader source
   * filenames, then to perform the compiling and linking when the shader
   * program is bound during the rendering. This means to check a flag at every
   * bind(). It could be sub-optimal to check such flag every time. However,
   * the alternative is to construct, load and reload a shader only during
   * rendering. This might be limiting, e.g.: if a button of the GUI allows to
   * load dynamically sources into a shader program, the filenames has to be
   * stored somewhere and then passed to the constructor of a shader program at
   * rendering. Thus, I chose the first solution: a little sub-optimal but less
   * constraints.
