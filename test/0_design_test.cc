/**
 * Toward a resource manager.
 *
 * First of all, I believe that resources should be stored/managed by type. I
 * am not sure this is the right way to do so, but I have the impression I
 * should start like that.
 * => one manager by resource type
 *
 * Also, I do not feel I will need to store managers in a container. Thus, there
 * is no reason to make all resources or managers inherit from a common base. We
 * can then use template.
 * => use templates
 *
 * Should we use UID (unique identifiers), handles or pointers to refer to resources?
 * - UID
 *   × by using string hashes, we can have something like get( "building_04" )
 *   × a hash value will be used instead of the string to search into the resource database
 *   × to avoid hashing the string every time, we could do:
 *   constexpr uint32_t building_04_id = hash( "building_04" );
 *   ...
 *   get( building_04_id );
 *     this way, the hash will be computed at compile time. The issue is for
 *     scripts, where the hash should be computed once and then cached.
 *   × collisions should be handled. I have seen a method to do so [1,2], but it may
 *     a little too complex for now. Instead, I propose to build a dictionary, built
 *     when the hash() function is called, and throw an exception when two words are
 *     given the same hash value. It may be brutal, but it works. When a user have
 *     an exception, he/she knows what words are in conflict and can change one of
 *     them.
 * - handles
 *   × nice way to manage resources in a tight buffer
 *   × how to get an handle for a resource? At resource creation, the handle can
 *     then be deployed to where the resource is used. We must then know where the
 *     resource is needed. An alternative, is to have a dictionary to go from a
 *     name to a handle, and add an entry a resource creation with the couple
 *     (name,handle). Still, the resource should be created before the handle is
 *     recovered from the dictionary. A simple fix could be to return a null handle
 *     if a resource with this name is not known. Then, we have a null handle, we
 *     can ask again to the dictionary if it knows the handle of a name. Thus, at
 *     every use of a handle, we should check if it is null. Note that this should
 *     not be done in the tight buffer, since what to return in case of a null
 *     handle? Instead, we can return an empty resource object, that will be filled
 *     when a resource with that name is loaded.
 *   × when a resource is reloaded, it should use the same memory place, to have
 *     the same handle.
 * - pointers
 *   × we could say that with basic pointers, a resource cannot be reloaded. If
 *     the raw memory is encapsulated inside a wrapper, I do not see why not.
 *   × we could say that resources will not be in contiguous memory. Still, if
 *     we wanted to contiguous memory, we would use an array, so I do not see
 *     the issue here.
 *   × How to get the pointers? We would go by name or by handles. Thus, this
 *     case is just an implementation detail of UID and handles.
 *
 * I have seen examples with UID, handles and pointers on the web, but I do not
 * make a clear separation between the three cases. I cannot see why we cannot use
 * the three. So, the main questions are:
 * - how to store the resources, both on client side and inside the manager?
 * - how to handle the destruction of a resource? e.g. when client still has a copy
 *
 * When a resource is destroyed, it is not clear to me that this resource should
 * continue to exist if it is still referred to by other parts of the code. For
 * example, if I destroy a particular mesh, I do not expect to still see it on
 * the screen: instances using that resource should now use an empty mesh. On the
 * other hand, an instance of empty mesh will still exist after the deletion of the
 * resource. Even if the memory consumption is expected to be lower, we still use
 * a mesh resource. Also, a segmentation fault occurring when accessing to a
 * destroyed resource will provide better debugging information.
 *
 * For now, I will simply store the resources inside the map. Clients will have
 * access to those resources thanks to references, meaning they should not keep such
 * references after resource deletion.
