    /**@brief A collection of transparent windows to render.
     *
     * A transparent window is a quad that let the light go through it. As such,
     * we can see any opaque object that lies behind a transparent window. We show
     * in this tutorial how to do it.
     *
     * First, a window is defined by its center, and two vectors that goes from
     * the center to two consecutive corners of that window. Those two vectors
     * are named v1 and v2, and should not be colinear (otherwise, you have a
     * zero-sized window by definition). Then, a window has a RGBA color.
     *
     * It should be noted that the current code can handle any orientation of the
     * corners. But if face culling is activated, some holes can appear depending
     * on the view point.
     *
     * A window has no thickness, but you can either add another parallel
     * window or modify the code to render a box instead of a quad.
     *
     * This code has a limitation related to the difficulty of performing
     * transparency with OpenGL: quads are not always in front of other
     * quads, thus, only parts of a quad need to be rendered before another
     * one. Partial primitive rendering is not possible with the rasterization
     * pipeline. There are more evolved rendering methods to address this issue,
     * like ray-tracing.
     * TODO: make a simple implementation of a ray-tracing (on the cpu).
